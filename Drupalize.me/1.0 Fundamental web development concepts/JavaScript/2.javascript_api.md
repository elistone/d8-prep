# JavaScript API

Once you can attach libraries to your pages there are a few Drupal specif things that help with making sure everything runs correctly.

## Drupal behaviours

It is very common with jQuery to wrap everything in a `$(document).ready()` function, which will ensure that are code only runs after the DOM has loaded.
However Drupal has a better method `Drupal.behaviours` and `once()`. These methods used together will make sure that your code not only runs when the DOM has loaded but also when data is loaded via AJAX.

For example say you are changing a click event on a button in a ajax view, using `$(document).ready()` would work great the first time the page loads however when you press next on the views pagination the click event would be lost - as the pages content gets reloaded.

Using `Drupal.behaviours` means then even when an AJAX event is fired the code will run again and re-attach the click event.

A basic example:

```javascript
Drupal.behaviors.myBehavior = {
  attach: function (context, settings) {
    // Using once() to apply the myCustomBehaviour effect when you want to run just one function.
    $('input.myCustomBehavior', context).once('myCustomBehavior').addClass('processed');

    // Using once() with more complexity.
    $('input.myCustom', context).once('mySecondBehavior').each(function () {
      if ($(this).visible()) {
        $(this).css('background', 'green');
      }
      else {
        $(this).css('background', 'yellow').show();
      }
    });
  }
};
```

## No Conflict

Since Drupal runs jQuery in `noConflict()` mode to use `$` shorthand in your code you must add wrappers around your code like such:

```javascript

(function ($, Drupal) {
  Drupal.behaviors.myModuleBehavior = {
    attach: function (context, settings) {
      $('input.myCustomBehavior', context).once('myCustomBehavior').each(function () {
        // Apply the myCustomBehaviour effect to the elements only once.
      });
    }
  };
})(jQuery, Drupal);

```

To make sure jQuery and jQuery.once are available in yous script you need to include them in your library as a dependency:

 ```yaml
foobar:
  js:
    js/foobar.js: {}
  dependencies:
    - core/jquery
    - core/jquery.once
```
