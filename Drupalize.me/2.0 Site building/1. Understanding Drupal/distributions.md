# Distributions

Distributions are full copies of Drupal that come with addition parts such as contrib modules, themes, libraries and installation profiles.

There are two types of distribution

- Full featured: complete solution for specialized cases.
- Other: quick start tools, good starting places for developers and site builders.

An example of Distributions would be:

- Open Social - https://www.drupal.org/project/social | Open Social is an out of the box solution for online communities.
- Thunder - https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder | A distribution for professional publishing
- Varbase - https://www.drupal.org/project/varbase | The Ultimate Drupal 8 CMS Starter Kit
