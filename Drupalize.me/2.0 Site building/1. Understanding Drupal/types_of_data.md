# Types of data

The data stored in Drupal can be broken up into 4 types:

## Content

This includes all types of information (text, images) that can be displayed to visitors. This information is mostly permanent but can normally be edited.


## Configuration

This is information about your site that is not content, will also be quite permanent but editable. It will be used for things like configuring default behavior, such as setting up mail systems.


## State

Holds information of a temporary nature, such as the time when the cron jobs were last run.


## Session

Information about individual site visitors, keeping track of things such as logged in and there cookies. This is also temporary.
