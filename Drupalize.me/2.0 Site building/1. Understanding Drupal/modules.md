# Modules

A module is a way to extend core functionality of Drupal, this is done generally to add things however it could be used to remove. 

Modules have to be installed to work, which gives you the option of having features or not. The more modules enabled on a site will generally decrease the speed at which a page can load.

Drupal core also splits it code into modules which means if there are certain aspects you don't require you can uninstall them.

Core includes (but is not limited to) the following functionally:

- Managing users (User Module)
- Managing content (Node & field modules)
- Creating lists, and displays of content (view and view UI modules)
