# Fields

Entities store data on individually inside on fields, each field can hold one type of data such as pain text, images or files. The types of field are defined by core or contrib modules.

Fields can be added/edited via the CMS by an administrator, changing the root entity will mean that all the others new and existing have the same collection of fields.
