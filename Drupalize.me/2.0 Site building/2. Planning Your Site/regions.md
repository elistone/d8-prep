# Regions

Drupal uses the concept of regions, these are places in a template that allow for the adding of content.

For example you might have a region called "header" this is where you would put things such as site name and top navigation, there could also be a sidebar left & right where you might put call to actions for certain pages. 

All of this will depend on the enabled theme design, the only region that must be defined is the one that contains the primary content everything else is optional.
